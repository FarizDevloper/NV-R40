🛰️ Tactical Thermal Camera NV -R 40
Intelligent Thermal Imaging & Target Detection System for Defense, Recon, and Field Operations

A robust Python-based thermal surveillance system engineered for military-grade field intelligence, integrating thermal vision, object detection, and a real-time tactical HUD. Designed to enhance situational awareness in low-visibility environments for operations such as recon, perimeter security, and mission monitoring.

🎯 Mission-Critical Features
🧠 AI-Powered Object Recognition
Integrated with YOLOv3 deep learning model for real-time identification of people, vehicles, and assets — day or night.

🌡️ Thermal Imaging Support
Compatible with MLX90640 thermal sensor for live infrared imaging. When unavailable, it simulates heat maps using proprietary thermal effects.

🌙 Night Vision Capability
Adaptive contrast enhancement for environments with limited or no light, boosting target visibility without revealing operator position.

📡 Heads-Up Display (HUD)
Real-time overlay showing system status, coordinates, minimap tracking, and operational time — inspired by modern combat optics.

📍 Minimap Object Tracker
Displays movement trajectories of detected targets across time — ideal for patrol analysis, breach detection, or tactical follow-up.

🔍 Zoom Mode
On-demand digital magnification for identifying distant or camouflaged subjects in the field.

📼 Video & Image Capture
Seamless session recording and instant frame capture for evidence collection, AAR (After Action Review), and data intelligence.

🧾 Telemetry Logging
Full log output of detection events, object types, timestamps, and spatial data — essential for mission debriefs and forensic reviews.

🛠️ System Requirements
Python 3.7+

Standard webcam (or field camera input via OpenCV)

Optional: MLX90640 thermal sensor via I2C for real infrared data capture
